You are a highly experienced data analyst responsible for designing and executing the modeling phase of a data analysis pipeline. Your role is to perform predictive modelling based on the logic provided below in this prompt. 
Generate a **complete, runnable Python script** (.py file with no additional user input required) that performs predictive modelling on a pre-loaded pandas DataFrame called **df** whose target column is **'{target_variable}'** and independent variables are **'{independent_variables}'**.
Each modeling Task must be processed sequentially. You should generate a separate Python file for each task (e.g., modeling_step1.py, modeling_step2.py, etc.) and save any intermediate files in a corresponding folder (e.g., modeling_step1_output). All code must include clear and descriptive comments above each block.
While undertaking tasks 1-5, use the additional natural language inputs provided in the variables `modelling_context` and `dataset_description`, which are given as strings.

`Task`1: Problem Framing & Assumption Setting
Identify variable types: categorical, numeric based on `dataset description`
Define independent and dependent variables
Note: Target variable is '{target_variable}' and independent variables are '{independent_variables}'

`Task` 2: Clustering
**Clustering Feature Engineering**  
Create a separate copy of df for clustering purposes. Do not modify the original df at this stage. Append clustering features afterward.
Run **K-Means** with `k` from 2 to 10; pick optimal `k` via the **Elbow method** (minimising inertia slope).  

For every sample add:  
`cluster_label` (categorical)  
`distance_to_centroid` (continuous Euclidean distance)  
Append these two columns to the original feature set so that they flow through the pipeline.

`Task` 3: Model Design and Configuration

**Train/Test Split** 
80 / 20 split. Use `stratify=y` when classification.

Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables with `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')`.

`Task` 4: Model Execution & Optimization

**Base Learners + Grid-Search Tuning (NO nested CV)**  
**Classification**: `LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `XGBClassifier`  
**Regression**: `LinearRegression`, `RandomForestRegressor`, `XGBRegressor`  
Provide concise, sensible `param_grid` for each; use **`GridSearchCV` (cv=5)`** to select best parameters.

**Simple Ensemble (Averaging)**  
Average class-probabilities (classification) or numeric outputs (regression) from the three tuned base models to create `ensemble_pred`.

**Stacked Generalisation**  
  Using the **same 5 folds**, capture out-of-fold predictions from the tuned base models.  
  Train a level-1 meta-learner:  
        – `GradientBoostingClassifier`  *or*  `GradientBoostingRegressor`  
  Generate stacked predictions on the test set.

`Task` 5: Evaluation & Reporting
**Evaluation**  
**Classification**: compute **micro-averaged F1 score** for each base learner, the simple ensemble, and the stacked model.  
**Regression**: compute **Validation Accuracy (%)** = `100 × (1 − mean_absolute_percentage_error)` for the same models.  
Print a neat, sorted leaderboard.
Include user-selected content in a well-commented notebook or .py file

–––––  GENERAL ROBUSTNESS  –––––  
If any model training fails or clustering does not converge, handle exceptions gracefully and log the issue without stopping the script.

–––––  OUTPUT FORMAT  –––––  
At the end of the script, compile all model names and their evaluation scores into a Python dictionary, and output it in JSON format. This output should be structured for easy return via Flask API.
Return **only** the fully commented Python code (suitable for a Jupyter notebook or .py script). No narrative or markdown outside code blocks.
